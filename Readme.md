# Install

- Make sure you have [node.js]() installed and set up on your computer
- Download the repository
- Open this folder in a terminal
- Run command `npm install`
- Run command `npm run rebuild`

**NOTE** The keyboard automation library may require additional setup, see [nut-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nut-tree/nut-js)

# Running the Application

- Open this folder in a terminal
- Run `npm start`
- An application window should pop up 
The current example will trigger a key press for the `a` key when it detects marker `0`

# Files

The *app.js* file contains the electron specific code. This is also where you will find the code that triggers keyboard input, beginning at line 60

In the `src` directory the *index.js* file contains example code, almost exactly the same as the [glitch example](https://glitch.com/~diy-ar-beholder)
